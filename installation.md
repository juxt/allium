## Get started

**Claude Code** (via the JUXT plugin marketplace):

```
/plugin marketplace add juxt/claude-plugins
/plugin install allium
```

**Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Aider, Continue and 40+ other tools:**

```
npx skills add juxt/allium
```

Once installed, your LLM will load the skill when it encounters `.allium` files or when you mention Allium in conversation.

**Manual installation:**

Allium is just markdown files. If your tool isn't listed above, or you prefer to manage things yourself, grab the files from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/juxt/allium) and place them wherever your LLM reads custom instructions from.
